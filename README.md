# <span style="color: #FF6347;">Stick Hero Game</span>

## <span style="color: #4682B4;">Description</span>
Stick Hero is an interactive game where the player controls a stick figure that must jump from platform to platform. The objective is to extend the stick to the correct length to reach the next platform without falling off. The game becomes increasingly challenging as the player progresses through multiple levels.

- <span style="color: #32CD32;">Multiple Levels</span>: The game has 10 levels, each with increasing difficulty.
- <span style="color: #32CD32;">Dynamic Stick Length</span>: The stick length is adjustable and must be calculated based on the distance between platforms.
- <span style="color: #32CD32;">Collision Detection</span>: The game accurately detects collisions with platforms and manages character movement across platforms.
- <span style="color: #32CD32;">Score Tracking</span>: The playerâ€™s score is displayed and updated as they progress through each level.
- <span style="color: #32CD32;">Smooth Animation</span>: The game includes animations for stick extension and character movement.
